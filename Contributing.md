## Contributor Guidelines

We encourage all members of the Aberdeen Centre for Health Data Science to contribute to this team project :smile:

Here is what you need to do:

**Before you start: set up a Github account**

Please set up a free [GitHub](https://github.com/) account and sign in. Here are some [instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account). Let [Dimitra](https://github.com/dblana) know you've done this so we can add you to the ACHDS organisation.

**1. Decide on how you'd like to contribute**

There are many different ways to contribute to this research project:

[TO DO: discuss the main aspects of the research project and come up with a list of issues describing the main tasks]

You might also just like to suggest improvements, but not make the changes yourself. This is also very welcome! In this case, you just need to do step 2 below: add an issue describing your suggested improvement.

**2. Add an issue describing your suggested contribution (or assign an existing issue to yourself)**

Once you've identified a way to contribute, please let us know what you're planning to do by adding a new issue [here](https://github.com/AbdnCHDS/covid-social-distancing/issues), or assign an existing issue to yourself. Issues are basically tasks that we want to achieve, so by adding your issue to the list we can keep track of who is working on what.

Please don't skip this step, as knowing what you're planning on doing in advance ensures you aren't overlapping with work that's currently underway and that everyone is on the same page with the goal of the work you're going to carry out. Here is [more information about Github issues](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/managing-your-work-with-issues).

**3. Create a new branch (and give it a name associated with the issue)**

Using a separate [branch](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-branches) allows you to isolate development work without affecting other branches in the repository. Please note that you need to make an initial commit in order to start a new branch on GitHub. This should be a small initial change (e.g. add a single sentence), that you follow by creating a draft pull request (step 4 below). Then you can keep making changes to your branch (step 5) for as long as you like. But by opening the draft pull request as early as possible in your workflow, it makes it clear to everyone in the team that you are working on the associated issue.

**4. Create a draft pull request and add "closes #[issue number]" in the description**

A [pull request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests) is the method by which you let us know of the contribution you have made. Adding "closes #[issue number]" in the description [links the pull request to the issue](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue#linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue-using-a-keyword). This shows that work is in progress to address the issue, and it automatically closes the issue when the pull request is merged.

**5. Go ahead and make your changes in the new branch**

Make sure you commit your changes frequently, and use good commit messages that briefly describe the changes you made.

**6. Change the draft pull request to "ready for review"**

When you are ready to get feedback from other team members, [change the draft pull request to ready to review](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/changing-the-stage-of-a-pull-request#marking-a-pull-request-as-ready-for-review). You can ask specific team members to [review your changes](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-request-reviews). 

**7. Merge the pull request**

When you get approval from the reviewer, merge the pull request and delete the branch (this closes the issue). It doesn't matter who merges the pull request (you or the reviewer), but successfully merging your changes is a satisfying action, so we recommend that you do it yourself - you've earned it after all your hard work.

**Well done!!** :balloon::balloon::balloon: And thank you :smiley:

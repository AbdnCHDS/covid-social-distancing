# The relationship between social distancing measure and impact of covid-19: a collaborative research project



## Hi! :wave:

Welcome! This repository is for an ongoing collaborative project by members of the Health Data Lab team from the [Centre for Health Data Science](https://www.abdn.ac.uk/achds/), part of the University of Aberdeen.

We are conducting research on the relationship between the [Grampian Social Distancing Score](https://jessbutler.github.io/social_distancing/#social-distancing-score) and COVID-19 outcomes including testing, case prevalence and mortality. The Social Distancing Score was developed by [@JessButler](https://github.com/JessButler) to identify areas that might be at greater risk of transmitting COVID-19 due to likely constraints in the ability to adhere to social distancing guidelines.
